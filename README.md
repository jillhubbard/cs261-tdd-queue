# You Don't Know Queues

But after this, you will.

In this assignment, you will engage in a test-driven development process to implement a queue, a FIFO data structure providing O(1) enqueue and dequeue operations. We'll call it a "Queue."

## Run the Test Suite

`python3 -m unittest test_queue`

Open both *test_queue.py* and *queue.py* in your editor of choice. Modify the implementation in *queue.py* to pass the first test. Once it passes, create a commit. Then, uncomment the next test, and re-run the test suite. Implement what's necessary to pass the test, and then repeat this process.

**But wait!**

Toward the middle of the test suite, you should be thinking about the algorithmic efficiency of each operation. Are the enqueue and dequeue operations O(1)?

## Best Done in Pairs!

Get together with a friend in front of just one machine, and take turns being the driver. Change drivers after each test is passed. Don't forget to commit after each test.
